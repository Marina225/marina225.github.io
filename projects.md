Before embarking on a research (PhD) journey, I started my IT career path as a backend/data intern and engineer at [Urgentem](https://www.urgentem.net/) in 2019. After that I enrolled in a MSc in Data Science during which I worked as a senior data scientist and project manager at [Altifio - Alertiee](https://alertiee.io/). I am currently cooperating as a data scientist and advisor at [Newscrypto](https://newscrypto.io/). 
I strive to remain being involved with the industry.

Additionally, since 2021 I am cooperating with individuals from [Innorenew CoE](https://innorenew.eu/) on various projects with respect to machine learning algorithms in relation to the environment.


I am a member of [HICUP Lab](https://hicup.famnit.upr.si/) focusing on human computer interaction. As a PhD student at the [University of Primorska](https://www.upr.si/en), more precisely at [FAMNIT](https://www.famnit.upr.si/en), my main focus is on recommender systems, under the supervision of Michael Mrissa and Marko Tkalcic. 

Since 2022 I am in the strokovni ekipi at a [BioPsi Student Conference](https://bio-psi-konferenca.famnit.upr.si/en/).
