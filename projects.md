## My journey

Before embarking on a research (PhD) journey, I started my IT career path as a backend/data intern and engineer at Urgentem (ADD WEBSITE) in 2019. After that I enrolled in a MSc in Data Science during which I worked as a senior data scientist and project manager at [Altifio - Alertiee](). I am currently cooperating as a data scientist and advisor at [Newscrypto]().
I strive to remain being involved with the industry.


I am a member of [HICUP Lab](https://hicup.famnit.upr.si/) focusing on human computer interaction.

I am a PhD student at the [University of Primorska](https://www.upr.si/en), more precisely at [FAMNIT](https://www.famnit.upr.si/en) as a member of DIST department.

Since 2022 I am in the strokovni ekipi at a [BioPsi Student Conference](https://bio-psi-konferenca.famnit.upr.si/en/).
